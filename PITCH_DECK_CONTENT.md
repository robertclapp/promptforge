## Slide 2: The $10B Market Opportunity
**Enterprise AI spending will reach $200B by 2026, with prompt engineering and optimization representing 5% of total costs**

Key Points:
- **$10 billion addressable market** for prompt management and optimization tools by 2026
- **87% of enterprises** now use multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral)
- **Average enterprise spends $50K-$500K annually** on AI API costs across providers
- **40% cost reduction possible** through optimized prompt selection and provider comparison
- **Prompt engineering teams growing 300% YoY** as AI adoption accelerates

Market Drivers:
- Explosion of LLM options creates provider selection complexity
- Rising API costs force enterprises to optimize spending
- Need for systematic evaluation and version control of prompts
- Compliance and audit requirements for AI decision-making

---

## Slide 3: The Problem
**Enterprise teams waste millions on suboptimal AI provider choices and lack systematic prompt evaluation**

Pain Points:
1. **No systematic way to compare costs** across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Mistral for the same prompt
2. **Manual testing is time-consuming** - engineers spend 20+ hours per week testing prompts across providers
3. **Hidden costs accumulate** - teams don't track token usage and latency across providers
4. **Version control chaos** - no Git-like system for prompt templates and context packages
5. **No audit trail** - compliance teams can't track prompt changes and evaluation results

Real-World Impact:
- Company A: Spent $120K on GPT-4 when Claude 3 would cost $68K (43% savings)
- Company B: No evaluation system led to 6-month delay in production deployment
- Company C: Manual testing across 4 providers took 80 engineer-hours per sprint

- Add context packages: Product docs, support guidelines
- Version control: Track changes over time

Step 3: Run Evaluation
- Define test cases with sample inputs
- Execute across all providers simultaneously
- View results: tokens, latency, cost, quality score

Results Example:
- **GPT-4**: 87 tokens, 1245ms, $0.0174, 95% quality
- **Claude 3**: 92 tokens, 1580ms, $0.0230, 92% quality
- **Gemini Pro**: 78 tokens, 980ms, $0.0098, 88% quality
